Digital Logic Learning App

- Lets users create circuits with drag-and-drop modules and wires
- Instructors can create, serialize & persist digital logic circuit puzzles into JSON files
- Students can load JSON files and solve premade & instructor-created circuit puzzles with automated feedback

How to Play:

Users can pick a level to play or choose to create one themselves. If a level is chosen to play user must drag and drop different logic gates in order to achieve the output specified in the description. If the user chooses to create a level themselves, they type in a name and description and specify the number of inputs and outputs. The user then creates the circuit of the solution to the logic circuit which is then saved and added to the list of playable levels.
